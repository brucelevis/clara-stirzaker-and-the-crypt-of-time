Clara will move around the tomb on her own. When she encounters a wall she will turn clockwise.
Press 'j' and 'k' on the keyboard or click/touch the left or right part of the screen to activate either the blue or the red pillars in the crypt. This will change the layout of the level and allow Clara to find the exit.

Good luck!
